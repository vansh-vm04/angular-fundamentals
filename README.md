# Angular Practice Project

This repository is a collection of Angular concepts and implementations that I explored while learning the framework.  
It is not a production-level project, but rather a **playground for practicing Angular fundamentals**.

## ðŸ“Œ Covered Topics
- Components & Modules
- Data Binding (Interpolation, Property, Event, Two-way)
- Directives (Structural & Attribute)
- Services & Dependency Injection
- Routing & Navigation
- Reactive Forms & Template-driven Forms
- Pipes (Built-in & Custom)
- Lifecycle Hooks
- Dynamic CSS Classes
- Control Flow with `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, etc.

## ðŸš€ Purpose
The goal of this repository is to **learn and practice Angular by building small demos** of its major features.  
This helped me gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the framework.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
